I added laps to the turtle race. I wasn't sure how to display
the laps but I was able to make it so the laps were implemented
and not obstructing the flow of the game. I also added a
victory screen to the game so that it displays the win or lost
message at the end of the game on the screen window instead of
the terminal.
