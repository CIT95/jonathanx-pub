# # Week 10 Learn Together

I made a new program for this weeks learn together around the idea
of having the user make a custom dice that can have anything be
assigned to the dice faces for their value. So the dice could be
used from all things from being a normal dice to being used for
things that need special faced dices. The dice could even be used
for random selection for people in groups of 6 or less depending on
who they intend to have double the chance to be rolled on. It was fun
to make then to intentionally add bugs into it was kind of tragic.

However, trying to find the intentionally placed bugs of my peer's
python programs was pretty fun.
