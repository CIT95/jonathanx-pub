# My Dev Work

I think something fun to create would be a small and simple video game. I am very interested in video games but I know that making a video game is pretty hard and I'm quite new to coding. This is why I think instead of being too ambitious with a full fledged video game, we could make more simple games like a guessing game. We could maybe even make a program that acts like a dice to be used in substitution of actual dice.
