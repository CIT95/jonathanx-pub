# Week 4 Learn Together

In this learn together, I wanted to create something that 
sort of replicates my thought process when it comes to wondering
what I want to eat or feel like eating. It is kind of sad to say
that I usually end up depending on randomly selecting something to
eat or just skip a meal altogether. Nonetheless, I kind of also
made this program to help me with my indecisiveness when it comes
to selecting a meal to eat. To be honest, I don't think it will be
able to command me to eat when I don't feel like it but I feel like
it will help to sway me towards an option instead of my usual thinking
about it and opting for the easiest option, microwaving a hot pocket or
last night's leftovers. Or probably the easiest but worst option of not
eating for that meal altogether. I'm not crazy enough to skip more than one
meal a day though. The thought of skipping more than one meal is a bit
on the dangerous side. I'm just rambling at this point. I will say though
I ran into a good amount of bugs on this learn together and I noticed that
the code became exceptionally long.
