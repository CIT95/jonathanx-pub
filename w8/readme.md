# Week 8 Learn Together

For this week's learn together, I decided to go back to my week 4 learn together
and try to improve upon it with the requirements for this week in mind. I was able
to improve certain features of the program but I feel like I hit a lot of walls
when I started rewriting the code. There was a lot of bugs that I worked out but
I think I had some redundant code here and there. I think I could've done a better
job at optimizing certain aspects of the code but I will figure that out another
day. I'm satisfied with what I did so far but I do think I can improve upon it
at a later date. Especially with the clean up of the code.
